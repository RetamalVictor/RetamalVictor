### Hey, I'm Victor

ML & Robotics Engineer working on autonomous systems, multi-agent coordination, and everything in between.

Currently at [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/) building multi-agent LLM orchestration platforms and UAV control systems. Previously did research on swarm robotics and MARL at VU Amsterdam.

I like building things that move, think, or ideally both.

#### What I'm working on

- **Multi-agent systems** — from LLM orchestration to UAV swarms
- **Embodied AI** — perception, control, and decision-making for robots
- **Edge deployment** — getting models to run fast on constrained hardware

#### Background

MSc AI @ VU Amsterdam / UvA (Cum Laude) — thesis on multi-agent RL for continuous control under partial observability.

Before that, BSc in Medicine — turns out I liked building things more than fixing people.
