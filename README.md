### Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm an MSc AI Student and Research Assistant @ VU Amsterdam. 
Here you'll find some of my work. Currently, I am working with Multiagent system in real and simulated environments. For the real part, I'm using Crazyflies Nano drones to carry on research projects. Mainly Collective behaviours, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Robotics.

This a list of the coolest and most relevant projects I have around here:

**Currently working**
- [Multi-robot Path Finding With Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/MAPF-GNN)
- [Robotic Car with Vision Guidance](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/robot-car)
- From Shadows to Light: A Swarm Robotics Approach with Onboard Control for Source Seeking in Constrained Environments (No public code yet, hopefully soon)
- Learned collectived behaviours with Distance-only information (Again, public code soon)
- Ultrasound Image Segmentation for Medical Images with Visual Transformers (Code available soon!)

**Finished**
- **(Acepted for ICRA2023)** [Onboard Controller Design for Nano UAV Swarm in Operator-Guided Collective Behaviours](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/crazyflie-firmware-VU)
- [Attention-Guided Simultaneous-Move Monte Carlo Tree Search (AG-SM-MCTS)](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/A3C-Attention-for-Simultaneous-game)
- [Variational Autoencoder and Adversarial Autoencoder (VAE & AAE)](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/uvadlc_practicals_2022/tree/main/VAE_and_AAE)
- [CLIP and transfer learning](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/uvadlc_practicals_2022/tree/main/CLIP_and_transferLearning)
- [NAO Social Robotics](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/NAO-Robot-Social-interations)
- [SAT solver DPLL for Sudokus](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/SAT_Solver)
- [Monte Carlo Tree Search MaxMin for TicTacToe](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/MCTS_TicTacToe)
- [GA & NEAT agent for EVOMAN](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/Genetic-Algorithm-and-NEAT-generalist-agent-Evoman)
- [GPX to Map parser](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/GPX_ParserApp)
- [Starcraft 2 Bots](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/starcraft-bot-amsterdam)
- [N-Queens with Evolutionary Algorithm](https://github.com/RetamalVictor/NQueens_problem_EA)
